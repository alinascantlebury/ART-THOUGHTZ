            <h1>Jayson Musson</h1>
            <h2>
                Jayson Scott Musson was born in the Bronx and came up through Philadelphia's art scene, getting his BFA
                in photography from the University of the Arts and his MFA in painting from the University of
                Pennsylvania. He also attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2011, right as his work was
                gaining serious traction. By the early 2010s, he had blue-chip gallery representation with Salon 94 in
                New York and Fleisher/Ollman in Philadelphia, showing work at major institutions like the Whitney
                Museum, MoCA Chicago, Whitechapel Gallery in London, and Galerie Perrotin in Paris. But while building
                this conventional gallery career, Musson simultaneously became a cult figure online through his
                satirical alter ego Hennessy Youngman and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HennesyYoungman">Art Thoughtz YouTube series</a>. Starting in 2010, filming
                from his Philadelphia apartment wearing a backwards hat and speaking in slang prose, Youngman broke down
                the art world and its .. with a mix of humor and uncomfortable truths.
